NAME
  ${me} - Computes vector cosine.

SYNOPSIS
  ${me} vector1 vector2

DESCRIPTION
  ${me} computes the dot product between a pair of vectors normalized
  by the respective magnitudes.  The input vector files must be lines
  of ordered pairs, sorted by the second element, and where the first
  element of each pair is the magnitude, and the second element of each
  pair is the dimension name.  This allows for arbitrary vector spaces
  with points specified sparsely.

  For example, a vector file may appear as follows:

    3 x
    4 y
    5 z

  for a vector with components x=3, y=4, and z=5.
