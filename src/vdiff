NAME
  ${me} - Computes vector difference.

SYNOPSIS
  ${me} vector1 vector2

DESCRIPTION
  ${me} computes the difference between a pair of vectors.
  The input vector files must be lines of ordered pairs,
  sorted by the second element, and where the first element
  of each pair is the magnitude, and the second element of
  each pair is the dimension name.  This allows for arbitrary
  vector spaces with points specified sparsely.

  For example, a vector file may appear as follows:

    3 x
    4 y
    5 z

  for a vector with components x=3, y=4, and z=5.
