NAME
  ${me} - Computes tf-idf

SYNOPSIS
  ${me} m tfvector dfvector

DESCRIPTION
  ${me} Computes tf-idf given the number document and  a tf vector and a
  df vector. The input vector files must be lines of ordered pairs, sorted
  by the second element, and where the first element of each pair is the
  magnitude, and the second element of each pair is the dimension name.
  This allows for arbitrary vector spaces with points specified sparsely.

  For example, a vector file may appear as follows:

    3 x
    4 y
    5 z

  for a vector with components x=3, y=4, and z=5.
